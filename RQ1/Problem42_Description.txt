PROBLEM: Minimum Cost to Merge Stones

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Hard

TAGS: Array, Dynamic Programming

DESCRIPTION:
There are n piles of stones arranged in a row. The ith pile has stones[i] stones.

A move consists of merging exactly k consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these k piles.

Return the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

Example 2:
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.

Example 3:
Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], k = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
