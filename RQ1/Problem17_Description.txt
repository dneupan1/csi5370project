PROBLEM: Count of Smaller Numbers After Self

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Hard

TAGS: Array, Binary Search, Divide and Conquer, Binary Indexed Tree, Segment Tree

DESCRIPTION:
Given an integer array nums, return an integer array counts where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [-1,-1]
Output: [0,0]

Input prompt for the implementation:

You are a software developer. You have been given a problem statement as below:
 ** description here **

Implement a solution based on the given examples in Python.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it is written that way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input prompt for the test code generation:

You are a software developer writing tests for some software functions.

Given below is a function:
  **** Generated Code is added here ****

Implement test for the given implementation using pytest in Python.
Ideal test code should have 100 percent test coverage.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it is written that way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input prompt for the repeating the test code generation in case the test fails.

The test code fails with following error:
 *** insert error from the console here ****

 Fix the error and regenerate the test code. Run the code against the function below until you have the tests passing. The function below is absolutely correct.
 *** insert the generated implementation code here ****
