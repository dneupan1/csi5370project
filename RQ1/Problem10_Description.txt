PROBLEM: Cherry Pickup

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Hard

TAGS: Array, Dynamic Programming, Matrix

DESCRIPTION:
You are given an n x n grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
1 means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.
Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below:

Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (n - 1, n - 1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1).
After reaching (n - 1, n - 1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells.
When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up, and the cell becomes an empty cell 0.
If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1), then no cherries can be collected.
 

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1,-1],[1,0,-1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1,-1],[1,-1,1],[-1,1,1]]
Output: 0

Input prompt for the test code generation:

You are a software developer writing tests for some software functions.

Given below is a function:
  **** Generated Code is added here ****

Implement test for the given implementation using pytest in Python.
Ideal test code should have 100 percent test coverage.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it is written that way.

Input prompt for the repeating the test code generation in case the test fails.

The test code fails with following error:
 *** insert error from the console here ****

 Fix the error and regenerate the test code. Run the code against the function below until you have the tests passing. The function below is absolutely correct.
 *** insert the generated implementation code here ****
