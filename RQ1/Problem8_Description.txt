PROBLEM: Reverse Nodes in k-Group

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Hard

TAGS: Linked List, Recursion

DESCRIPTION:
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
  Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
  Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

Input prompt for the implementation:

You are a software developer. You have been given a problem statement as below:
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
  Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
  Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

Implement a solution based on the given examples in Python.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it is written that way.

Input prompt for the test code generation:

You are a software developer writing tests for some software functions.

Given below is a function:
  **** Generated Code is added here ****

Implement test for the given implementation using pytest in Python.
Ideal test code should have 100 percent test coverage.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it is written that way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input prompt for the repeating the test code generation in case the test fails.

The test code fails with following error:
 *** insert error from the console here ****

 Fix the error and regenerate the test code. Run the code against the function below until you have the tests passing. The function below is absolutely correct.
 *** insert the generated implementation code here ****

Input prompt for the test code generation from natural language prompt only.

You are a test driven software developer who is going to write test cases for a given problem description first.

Given below is the problem description and some examples:

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
  Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
  Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
  
Implement test for the given problem description using pytest in Python.
Ideal test code should have 100 percent test coverage.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
