PROBLEM: Bulb Switcher II

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Medium

TAGS: Math, Bit Manipulation, DFS, BFS

DESCRIPTION:
There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:

Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).
Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).
Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).
You must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.

Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1, presses = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off] by pressing button 1
- [on] by pressing button 2

Example 2:
Input: n = 2, presses = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off, off] by pressing button 1
- [on, off] by pressing button 2
- [off, on] by pressing button 3

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, presses = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off, off, off] by pressing button 1
- [off, on, off] by pressing button 2
- [on, off, on] by pressing button 3
- [off, on, on] by pressing button 4

Input prompt for the implementation:

You are a software developer. You have been given a problem statement as below:
 ** description here **

Implement a solution based on the given examples in Python.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it is written that way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input prompt for the test code generation:

You are a software developer writing tests for some software functions.

Given below is a function:
  **** Generated Code is added here ****

Implement test for the given implementation using pytest in Python.
Ideal test code should have 100 percent test coverage.
Follow good software developer practices while generating the code.
Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it is written that way.

Input prompt for the repeating the test code generation in case the test fails.

The test code fails with following error:
 *** insert error from the console here ****

 Fix the error and regenerate the test code. Run the code against the function below until you have the tests passing. The function below is absolutely correct.
 *** insert the generated implementation code here ****
