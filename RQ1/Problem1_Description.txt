PROBLEM: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Medium

TAGS: Hash Table, String, Sliding Window

DESCRIPTION:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
