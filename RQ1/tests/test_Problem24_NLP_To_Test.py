    Tests the findTargetSumWays function with various arrays and targets to ensure it correctly counts the number of ways to reach the target sum by adding '+' and '-' signs.

    This test function verifies:
    - Proper counting of combinations that result in the target sum, including arrays with zeros which may increase combinations.
    - Edge cases such as empty input arrays, arrays with only zeros, and arrays where no combination can achieve the target.
    - Behavior with both small and large arrays and different types of number combinations.
    
    Args:
    nums (list of int): The list of integers to form expressions.
    target (int): The target sum to achieve.
    expected (int): The expected number of different expressions that evaluate to the target.
