def test_max_envelopes(envelopes, expected):

    Tests the max_envelopes function with various configurations of envelopes to ensure it correctly calculates the maximum number of envelopes that can be Russian dolled.

    This test function verifies:
    - The function's ability to handle a range of envelope configurations, including edge cases with no envelopes or only one envelope.
    - Proper calculation in scenarios where envelopes have the same width or height, which complicates the nesting conditions.
    - Functionality when sorting and decision-making are required to determine the optimal order of nesting.

    Args:
    envelopes (list of list of int): Each sublist represents an envelope's width and height.
    expected (int): The expected maximum number of envelopes that can be nested.
