    Tests the min_coins function with various configurations of coin denominations and amounts to ensure it calculates the fewest number of coins needed.

    This test function verifies:
    - The function's ability to find the minimum number of coins required for different amounts.
    - Proper handling of cases where no combination can meet the amount.
    - Functionality with zero amount, which should require zero coins.
    - Responses to edge cases such as large amounts, small amounts, and varied coin denominations.

    Args:
    coins (list of int): The denominations of coins available.
    amount (int): The total amount of money that needs to be made up with the coins.
    expected (int): The expected minimum number of coins required to make the amount, or -1 if it's not possible.
