    Tests the max_coins function with various balloon arrays to ensure it correctly calculates the maximum coins one can collect.

    This test function verifies:
    - The function's ability to compute the maximum coins from different arrays with varying complexities.
    - Handling of edge cases such as no balloons, a single balloon, and arrays with zeros.
    - Effectiveness in identifying the optimal bursting order to maximize coin collection.

    Args:
    nums (list of int): The numbers on the balloons, representing potential coins collected when bursting.
    expected (int): The expected maximum coins collectible from the given array of balloons.
