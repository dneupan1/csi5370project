    Tests the shortest_palindrome function with various strings to ensure it correctly identifies the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters at the beginning of the string.

    This test function verifies:
    - Proper handling of simple, complex, and edge cases, including single character strings and empty strings.
    - Correct transformation into a palindrome for both palindromic and non-palindromic input strings.
    - Efficiency and correctness in adding the minimal number of characters required to form a palindrome.

    Args:
    input_string (str): The original string to transform into a palindrome.
    expected_output (str): The expected shortest palindrome after transformation.
