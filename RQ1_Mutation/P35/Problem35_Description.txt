PROBLEM: Palindrome Pairs

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: Hard

TAGS: Array, Hash Table, String, Tree

DESCRIPTION:
You are given a 0-indexed array of unique strings words.

A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:

0 <= i, j < words.length,
i != j, and
words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a 
palindrome
.
Return an array of all the palindrome pairs of words.

You must write an algorithm with O(sum of words[i].length) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["abcddcba","dcbaabcd","slls","llssssll"]

Example 2:
Input: words = ["bat","tab","cat"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]

Example 3:
Input: words = ["a",""]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["a","a"]

Hint 1: Checking every two pairs will exceed the time limit. It will be O(n^2 * k). We need a faster way.
Hint 2: If we hash every string in the array, how can we check if two pairs form a palindrome after the concatenation?
Hint 3: We can check every string in words and consider it as words[j] (i.e., the suffix of the target palindrome). We can check if there is a hash of string that can be the prefix to make it a palindrome.
