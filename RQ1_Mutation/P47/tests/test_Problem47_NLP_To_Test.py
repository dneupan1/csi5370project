    Tests the does_cross function with a series of distance arrays to determine if a path crosses itself.

    This test function ensures the path crossing logic correctly identifies whether the movements based on the provided distances result in crossing the path at any point:
    - The function is tested against known scenarios with expected outcomes.
    - It includes simple and complex path patterns.
    - Edge cases such as minimal movements and empty inputs are tested to ensure robust handling of such cases.

    Args:
    distance (list of int): The sequence of distances moved in each direction starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise.
    expected (bool): The expected outcome whether the path crosses itself or not.
