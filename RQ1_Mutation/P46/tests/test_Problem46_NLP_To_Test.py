    Tests the find_increasing_triplet function with various arrays of integers to determine if a valid increasing triplet exists.

    This test function aims to:
    - Validate the correct identification of triplets across diverse scenarios including sequences, unordered lists, and lists with no possible triplets.
    - Check boundary conditions with minimal or no elements.
    - Ensure the function can handle variations in magnitude and sequence gaps.

    Args:
    nums (list of int): List of integers where we need to find if any increasing triplet exists.
    expected (bool): Expected result indicating whether an increasing triplet exists or not.
